# Another Starter Theme
Yes, another WordPress starter theme, based on another starter theme, oh yeah!!!
And I added some styling to make it more attractive.

## Why?
I like experiment with things. I checked mixing [Material Design](http://google.com/design) with bootstrap and here it is.

## What it offeres
Nothing special that much:

* Based on [_s](https://github.com/Automattic/_s)
* Based on [bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)
* Based on [_bootstraps](https://github.com/tareq1988/_bootstraps)
* A simple theme options panel, based on @Tareq1988 [Settings API class](https://github.com/tareq1988/wordpress-settings-api-class)
* Two column (content - *col-md-8*, sidebar - *col-md-4*)
* One navigation menu. Yes, it's styled, you don't have to write css for this fracking menubar again.
* Pagination
* LESS CSS
* Font Awesome
* Responsive
